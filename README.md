My (delayed) One Billiow Row Challenge write in Golang.

This is my first Go code after several weeks studying the language and its concepts. :tada: 

[The one billion row challenge](https://github.com/gunnarmorling/1brc) it's a challenge created for Java performance testing. The instructions can be checked in challenge repository.

Here's a simplified version where I'm reading the .TXT file with around 1 million lines and sorting exactly like the challenge requirements.

> [!IMPORTANT]  
> It's possible to increase even more the "measurements.txt" file data. Just run the script "script.py" in the project root with number of lines as command parameter. Example: "python ./script.py 1_000_000_000. This will generate 1 billion lines of data.

# onebillion-row-challenge-go

My (delayed) One Billiow Row Challenge write in Golang.

This is my first Go code after several weeks studying the language and its concepts. :tada: 

[The one billion row challenge](https://github.com/gunnarmorling/1brc) it's a challenge created for Java performance testing. The instructions can be checked in challenge repository.

It's a simplified version where I'm reading a .CSV file with around 44 thousand lines and ordering just like the challenge requirements.

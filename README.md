[The one billion row challenge](https://github.com/gunnarmorling/1brc) it's a challenge created for Java performance testing. The instructions can be checked in challenge repository.

Here's a simplified version where I'm reading the .TXT file with around 1 million lines and sorting exactly like the challenge requirements.
